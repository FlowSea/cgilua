CGILua is a tool for creating dynamic HTML pages and manipulating input
data from forms. It is simple but powerful, allowing complex tasks to
be carried out with minimum effort.

CGILua uses the interpreted language Lua as a server-side scripting
language for creating dynamic Web pages.

CGILua's architecture is divided into two layers. On the first layer
reside the launchers. All of them implement a Basic API that is used
by the second layer giving it portability. On the second layer reside
most of CGILua: HTML pre-processing, POST data processing, URL-encoding
etc.
