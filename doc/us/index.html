<h2><a name=whatis>What is CGILua?</a></h2><p>

<B>CGILua</b> is a tool for creating dynamic HTML pages and manipulating input
data from forms. 
It is simple but powerful, allowing complex tasks to be carried out
with minimum effort. Typical applications that can be developed 
with CGILua include, for instance, WWW information systems based on external 
data (databases) and WWW gateways to existing systems.<p>

<b>CGILua</b> uses the interpreted language <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>
as a server-side scripting language for creating dynamic Web pages. Both 
pure <a href="scripts.html#lscripts">Lua scripts</a> and 
<a href="templates.html">HTML templates</a> are supported by CGILua. 
A Lua script is essentially a Lua program that creates the 
contents of an HTML page and sends it to the HTTP server. An HTML template is 
a conventional HTML file that embeds Lua code by using some special marks.

<p>Lua scripts and HTML templates are equally easy to use, 
and choosing one of them 
basically depends on the characteristics
of an specific page. While HTML templates are convenient for 
creating graphically sophisticated pages, probably with the help
of an HTML editor, Lua scripts are more adequate for creating
pages that are simple in terms of its HTML structure, but require a 
significative amount of internal processing.  By also allowing these two methods to be 
intermixed, CGILua provides Web applications developers with great
flexibility when both requirements are present. For a detailed description
of both scripting methods and some examples of their use 
see <a href="scripts.html">CGILua scripts</a>.
